## Contributing

This manual is currently *very* incomplete and missing most of its content, so
any contribution is appreciated. If you wish to add information (and are
confident about its accuracy) or otherwise help laying out the manual, feel free
to open a pull request with your additions. See the project's README in the root
of the repository for more details.
